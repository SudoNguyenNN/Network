Also make sure you’ve changed the password authentication method for mysql root user as described under section titled “2.2 Change authentication method for MySQL root user” in the above guide. You must do this if you want to manage database server using any external programs such as phpMyAdmin.

Once you’ve setup LAMP stack, enable ‘universe’ repository, which is disabled by default on Ubuntu 18.04.  To do so, run:

    sudo add-apt-repository universe
    
Now is the time to install phpMyAdmin.

To install phpMyAdmin on Ubuntu 18.04, run:

     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install phpmyadmin php-mbstring php-gettext
     
Now, select the web server that should be automatically configured to run phpMyAdmin. Choose the web server with UP/DOWN arrows and hit the SPACEBAR key. Once you chose the web server, you will see a * (star) symbol in-front of it. Hit the TAB key to choose OK and again hit ENTER key to continue.

Once phpmyadmin is installed, enable mbstring php extension and restart Apache service o update the changes as shown below.

    sudo phpenmod mbstring
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    
**Access phpMyAdmin dashboard**

Open your web browser and navigate to http://ip-address/phpmyadmin or http://domain/phpmyadmin. You should see the phpmyadmin login page. Log in to the phmyadmin interface either using mysql root user or the new user which we created in the previous step.
