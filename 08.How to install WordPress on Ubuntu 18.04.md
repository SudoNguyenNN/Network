## How to install WordPress on Ubuntu 18.04

Install WordPress on Ubuntu 18.04

Before we begin, let’s update and upgrade the system. Login as the root user to your system and update the system to update the repositories.
   
      apt update && apt upgrade

Next, we are going to install the LAMP stack for WordPress to function. LAMP is short for Linux Apache MySQL and PHP.

**Step 1: Install Apache**

Let’s jump right in and install Apache first. To do this, execute the following command.

    apt install apache2

To confirm that Apache is installed on your system, execute the following command.

    systemctl status apache2

To verify further, open your browser and go to your server’s IP address.

    https://ip-address

**Step 2: Install MySQL**

Next, we are going to install the MariaDB database engine to hold our WordPress files. MariaDB is an open-source fork of MySQL and most of the hosting companies use it instead of MySQL.

    apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client

OUTPUT

Let’s now secure our MariaDB database engine and disallow remote root login.

    mysql_secure_installation
    
The first step will prompt you to change the root password to login to the database. You can opt to change it or skip if you are convinced that you have a strong password. To skip changing type n.

For safety’s sake, you will be prompted to remove anonymous users. Type Y.

Next, disallow remote root login to prevent hackers from accessing your database. However, for testing purposes, you may want to allow log in remotely if you are configuring a virtual server

Next, remove the test database.

Finally, reload the database to effect the changes.

**Step 3: Install PHP**

Lastly, we will install PHP as the last component of the LAMP stack.

    apt install php php-mysql

OUTPUT

To confirm that PHP is installed , created a info.php file at /var/www/html/ path

    vim /var/www/html/info.php

Append the following lines:

    <?php
    phpinfo();
    ?>
    
Save and Exit.

Open your browser and append /info.php to the server’s URL.

    https://ip-address/info.php

OUTPUT

**Step 4: Create WordPress Database**

Now it’s time to log in to our MariaDB database as root and create a database for accommodating our WordPress data.

    mysql -u root -p
    
OUTPUT

Create a database for our WordPress installation.

    CREATE DATABASE wordpress_db;
OUTPUT

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iuCReCa.png">

Next, create a database user for our WordPress setup.

    CREATE USER 'wp_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
OUTPUT

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GTU4Q80.png">

Grant privileges to the user

Next, grant the user permissions to access the database

    GRANT ALL ON wordpress_db.* TO 'wp_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

OUTPUT

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1OwijZg.png">

Great, now you can exit the database.

    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    Exit;

**Step 5: Install WordPress CMS**

Go to your temp directory and download the latest WordPress File

    cd /tmp && wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz

OUTPUT

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X09BWBC.png">

Next, Uncompress the tarball which will generate a folder called “wordpress”.

    tar -xvf latest.tar.gz

OUTPUT

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZNX7NnH.png">

Copy the wordpress folder to /var/www/html/ path.

    cp -R wordpress /var/www/html/

Run the command below to change ownership of ‘wordpress’ directory.

    chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/wordpress/

change File permissions of the WordPress folder.

    chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/wordpress/
    
Create ‘uploads’ directory.

    mkdir /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-content/uploads

Finally, change permissions of ‘uploads’ directory.

    chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/

Open your browser and go to the server’s URL. In my case it’s

    https://server-ip/wordpress

You’ll be presented with a WordPress wizard and a list of credentials required to successfully set it up.

Fill out the form as shown with the credentials specified when creating the WordPress database in the MariaDB database.

Leave out the database host and table prefix and Hit ‘Submit’ button.

NOTE: Hoặc có thể thay đổi ở trong file

`vi /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php`

NOTE: Nên thêm 2 dòng này vào file wp-config.php để tránh bị lỗi URL

      define('WP_HOME','http://example.com');
      define('WP_SITEURL','http://example.com');

If all the details are correct, you will be given the green light to proceed. Run the installation.
